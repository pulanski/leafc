<!-- TODO written in markdown and compiled into a [PDF]( -->

This book is the primary reference for the **Leaf language**. It is a
**work in progress** and will be updated as the language evolves.
The book is written in an _attempt to formalize_ the **language's design** and
provide a reference for future contributors. The book is divided into the
following sections:

- Chapters that informally describe the language's **syntax** and **grammar**.

- Chapters that informally describe the language's **semantics**.

- Chapters that informally describe the language's standard library.

- Chapters that informally describe the language's compiler and runtime, including
the compiler's intermediate representation (IR), linkage model, and debugging
utilities.
