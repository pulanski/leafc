# Mathematical Symbols

Inspired by the use of mathematical symbols in both the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/),
and [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) and the
**expressive** and **concise** syntax that results from their use, the Leaf
language uses mathematical symbols for various **mathematical constants**,
**functions**, and **operators**.
