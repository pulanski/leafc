## Lifetime

Inspired by both [Cyclone and Rust](https://pling.jondgoodwin.com/post/cyclone/),
a **lifetime** is a name that is used to define the **scope** of a variable or reference.
A **lifetime** is a sequence of one or more ASCII letters and underscores,
starting with a `'` (e.g. `'a`, `'static`, `'foo`, `'ðŸ¦€` etc.).

### Regex
